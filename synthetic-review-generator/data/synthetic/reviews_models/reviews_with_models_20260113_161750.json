The merge request interface has some decent features for tracking changes. Cons: The code review experience is painfully slow and clunky compared to other platforms. The diff viewer frequently breaks with larger files, making reviews nearly impossible. Notifications are unreliable - I constantly miss important review requests or get spammed with irrelevant updates. The UI feels outdated and navigation between projects is confusing. Merge conflicts are handled poorly with limited resolution tools. Performance issues are constant - pages take forever to load, especially when viewing file histories. For a tool meant to facilitate collaboration, it creates more friction than it solves. Would not recommend for serious development teams.",

Pros: GitLab's merge request workflow is excellent - the approval process, inline commenting, and conflict resolution tools make code reviews smooth. The built-in CI/CD pipelines have streamlined our deployment process significantly. I love having everything in one platform rather than juggling multiple tools. Branch protection rules and merge policies give me good control over code quality. The issue tracking integration with merge requests helps maintain traceability from feature request to deployment. Cons: The web interface can feel sluggish with large repositories, and the UI isn't as polished as some competitors. Pipeline debugging could be more intuitive - troubleshooting failed builds sometimes requires digging through logs that aren't well organized. The mobile experience is pretty poor for reviewing merge requests on the go. Notifications can be overwhelming without careful configuration.",
