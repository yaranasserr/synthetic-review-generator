The ability to link issues to merge requests is useful, and having everything in one platform theoretically makes sense for development teams. Cons: The project management features feel clunky and underdeveloped compared to dedicated tools like Jira or Asana. The board view is slow and often buggy, with issues randomly disappearing or not updating properly. Epic management is confusing and lacks intuitive hierarchy visualization. The UI is overwhelming with too many nested menus, making simple tasks take longer than they should. Time tracking is basic at best, and reporting capabilities are severely limited. For serious project management needs, you'll likely need additional tools anyway.",

Would appreciate more granular notification settings for different types of workflow events.",
