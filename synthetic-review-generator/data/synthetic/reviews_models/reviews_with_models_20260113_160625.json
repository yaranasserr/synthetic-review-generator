The ability to create, assign, and prioritize issues allows for seamless collaboration within teams. The integration of milestones and boards helps visualize progress effectively. Customizable templates for issues streamline our workflow significantly. Cons: While the platform is feature-rich, the learning curve can be steep for new users. Some advanced features are not immediately intuitive, and it can take time to fully leverage the tool's capabilities. Additionally, occasional performance lags during peak usage can be frustrating.",

The integrated CI/CD pipeline visibility helps track deployments. Issue linking and milestone tracking work well for project management. Self-hosted options give us control over our data. Cons: The web interface is painfully slow, especially when reviewing large merge requests or browsing file histories. Navigation feels clunky compared to competitors. The merge request diff viewer often times out on bigger changes. Notification management is poor - either too many alerts or missing critical ones. Search functionality across repositories is unreliable. Regular UI changes break our established workflows without clear migration paths.",

The kanban boards help visualize workflow, and I appreciate having everything integrated in one platform rather than juggling separate tools. The ability to link issues to merge requests is handy for tracking development progress. Custom issue templates save time and ensure consistency across the team. Cons: The interface feels cluttered and overwhelming at times - too many options buried in menus. Issue filtering could be more intuitive, and the search functionality is inconsistent. Board customization is limited compared to dedicated project management tools. Loading times can be slow with larger projects, and the mobile experience for managing issues is poor. Some team members find the learning curve steep.",

Comments frequently disappear or don't save properly, forcing us to rewrite feedback multiple times.
