Shared runners work well for basic workloads, and the pipeline visualization helps with debugging. Auto DevOps features save time on standard deployments. The ability to use Docker images as runners is flexible, and the artifact management between jobs is solid. Cons: Self-hosted runners can be unreliable and often go offline without clear indicators. Pipeline execution times are inconsistent, sometimes taking 2x longer than expected. The UI becomes sluggish with complex pipelines, and nested includes make YAML debugging painful. Limited Windows runner support compared to competitors. Cache management between jobs is hit-or-miss.",

The board view helps visualize workflow stages, and integration with merge requests creates nice traceability. Project templates save time on setup. The ability to link issues across projects is useful for larger organizations. Time tracking built into issues is a nice touch that many competitors charge extra for. Cons: The interface feels cluttered and overwhelming at times - too many options scattered across different menus. Issue search could be more intuitive and faster. The mobile experience for project management is pretty poor. Notifications can get overwhelming without careful configuration. Some basic PM features like Gantt charts require premium tiers. Loading times for large projects with many issues can be frustratingly slow.",

The integrated CI/CD pipelines are incredibly powerful and flexible - being able to define complex workflows in YAML is a game-changer. Git repository management is smooth, and the merge request process with built-in code review tools streamlines our development workflow. The issue tracking and project management features help keep everything organized in one place. Self-hosted options give us full control over our data, which is crucial for our enterprise needs. Pipeline caching and parallel job execution significantly reduced our build times. Cons: The web interface can feel sluggish at times, especially when viewing large repositories or complex pipeline logs. The learning curve for advanced CI/CD features is steep - took our team weeks to master all the YAML configuration options. Some UI elements feel cluttered compared to simpler alternatives. Occasional sync issues between the web interface and actual pipeline status. Premium features pricing can get expensive for larger teams.",
