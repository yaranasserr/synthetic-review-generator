1,"A Developer's Best Friend",5.0,"GitLab is pretty straightforward to use for day-to-day development work. Setting it up and getting CI/CD running doesn't take much effort, which I really appreciate. Having everything in one place — code, issues, and pipelines — makes working with the team smoother. Also, whenever we've reached out, the support team has been quick and helpfull.","Since GitLab offers so many features, it can feel a bit overwhelming when you're just starting out. Also, I've noticed that performance can slow down a little when working with larger repositories, but it's not a big issue once you get used to the workfloww"
2,"GitLab: Powerful All-in-One DevOps, but Can Be Heavy for Small Teams",5.0,"GitLab is an all-in-one DevOps platform that brings everything — from code hosting and CI/CD pipelines to issue tracking and security — under one roof. The best part is its seamless CI/CD integration, which makes automating builds, tests, and deployments incredibly easy. Its Merge Request workflows, inline code reviews, and visibility into pipelines help teams collaborate efficiently. The user interface is clean, intuitive, and works great for both small teams and enterprise-scale projects.","While GitLab is powerful, it can feel heavy for smaller projects. The initial setup for CI/CD runners and permissions can be a bit complex, especially for new users. Occasionally, pipeline execution speed slows down for larger repos, and the pricing for premium tiers can be high for startups. Also, the UI could load faster when dealing with large numbers of issues or merge requests."
3,"All-in-one DevOps platform that keeps our team aligned and shipping faster",4.5,"Everything in one place - code, CI/CD, issues, and deployments. The CI/CD pipeline is powerful and easy to configure. Code review and merge requests work well for our workflow. The built-in container registry and package registry are convenient. GitLab Pages is great for hosting docs. The self-hosted option gives us control when needed. Overall, it streamlines our DevOps workflow.","The UI can be slow, especially with large repos or many pipelines. Some advanced features are only in higher tiers. The search could be better. The interface can feel cluttered. Documentation is extensive but sometimes hard to find. Runner management can be tricky at scale."
4,"A great enterprise repository solution",4.5,"The user interface is excellent. It makes tasks like viewing and searching code, opening and reviewing merge requests, as well as creating tags and managing pipelines, all very straightforward and accessible.","There are some useful features, but for instance, the ability to add two reviewers to a merge request is restricted by a paywall. This limitation is disappointing, especially for a self-hosted solution where you would expect more flexibility."
5,"All-in-One DevOps Platform with Reliable CI/CD and Excellent Traceability",5.0,"Single platform: I like that GitLab combines source control, CI/CD, issue tracking, and monitoring in one place, which reduces tool sprawl and simplifies support. Reliable CI/CD pipelines: Pipelines are easy to troubleshoot with clear logs and job history, making it faster to identify deployment or build failures. Good visibility and traceability: Every change is linked to commits, merge requests, and issues, which helps when investigating incidents or regressions.","I currently do not have any dislikes about GitLab. The platform has consistently met our operational and support needs,"
6,"Gitlab Review",5.0,"GitLab brings source control, CI pipelines, security scanning, and deployment automation into a single place, which makes daily development a lot smoother. The consistency across the platform reduces the mental overhead of switching between tools. I like that everything feels unified rather than bolted together. The integrated CI system is especially helpful because it requires almost no external setup, and merge requests tie directly into automated tests, security scans, and approvals. The platform scales well for both solo projects and enterprise work, and it stays reliable even with heavy pipeline workloads.","The main drawback is that GitLab can feel slow at times, especially with large repositories or when pipeline queues are busy. Some advanced features sit behind higher-tier pricing, which makes the free tier feel limited compared to competitors. The UI can be overwhelming because there are so many features packed into the navigation, and it sometimes takes longer than expected to find the setting you want. Integration with third-party services is good but not always as smooth as GitHub."
7,"One tool to Plan, Build and Deliver faster.",5.0,"The best thing about GitLab is that you do not need to use multiple tools. It covers git repo, ci/cd, sprint planning, tracing issues,and deployment. It comes with built in ci/cd which works out of the box. By just adding .xml file, we can set up ci/cd easily, no third party integration needed. So for any project easy to build, test and deploy. We're using GitLab frequently and it helps everyone from developers to project manager.","Sprint planning is simpler compared to other tools."
8,"Gitlab is strong & cool open-source alternative of Github",5.0,"The all-in-one setup is probably its biggest win. You get Git repos, CI/CD, issue tracking, and project management in one place. No jumping between tools. The CI/CD pipeline system is solid once you get it running. The YAML config gives you good control, and the built-in runners work well for most projects. Issue tracking integrates nicely with merge requests. You can link branches to issues automatically, which keeps things organized. GitLab's pretty straightforward to get running. The community edition has good forum support, and paid tiers get direct help. Once your team gets used to it, GitLab becomes the everyday tool for everything.","The interface can feel cluttered. There's a lot going on, and finding what you need sometimes takes too many clicks."
9,"Unified DevSecOps with Strong CI/CD Pipelines",4.5,"I appreciate how GitLab brings the entire DevSecOps lifecycle into a single unified platform, reducing tools sprawl and making my workflow more efficient. GitLab's built-in CI/CD pipelines are one of its strongest features. They are easy to configure using .gitlab-ci.yml, provide powerful automation, and eliminate the need for separate CI tools, making environment deployment easy. The initial setup was moderately easy, and I found GitLab's documentation very helpful in making the installation straightforward.","While GitLab is a powerful and unified DevSecOps platform, there are areas where usability and performance could be improved, specifically the user interface complexity and pipeline speed and resource consumption."
10,"Powerful Group Structure and Seamless CI/CD Integration, but can be a bit complicated at first",5.0,"I love the group structure and how I am able to control the granularity of organization. I also really like Gitlab's CI/CD integration, making it very easy to run it with Gitlab Runner.","The group structure is sometimes a double edged sword as different organizations have different ways of structuring their group, and the learning curve may be a bit high if you are just joining, as it is different than what they might be used to."
11,"GitLab: The All-in-One Solution for Developers",5.0,"GitLab offers everything a developer needs to manage their projects. I find it easy to share code, review my recent changes, and it also helps me identify issues introduced by other developers.","As of now i dont find something that i don't like about gitlab."
12,"Excellent all-in-one solution for code hosting, CI/CD, and team collaboration",5.0,"I appreciate that GitLab provides an all-in-one solution for version control, continuous integration, and project management. The built-in CI/CD features are powerful and easy to set up, and I love being able to track issues, merge requests, and deployments without switching tools. The documentation and community support are also excellent.","GitLab is very powerful, but the learning curve can be steep, especially for teams that are new to DevOps tools. Some integrations or third-party apps don't always work as smoothly as expected, and occasionally there are minor bugs or delays when running pipelines."
13,"Simple, Scalable, Secure, and Seamless DevOps Platform.",5.0,"Scalability, Security, wonderful ui-ux. To me, it has been the best DevOps platform, easy to configure seamless CI/CD pipeline.","Large repositories are problematic, besides the initial setup seems complex, and the limited integration due to Kubernetes is a challenge."
14,"One of the best version control tool for free",5.0,"Gitlab is super easy to use, making it a great tool for handling code and collaboration with teammates. It's simple to set up, and if you ever need help, their customer support team is quick to assist. With its friendly interface and useful number of features, Gitlab makes managing and merging code a breeze for any project.","There is nothing to dislike, I phase one issue when I used it in mobile web. I got confused in user interface of mobile view to merge code request. On other hand everthing is good to go."
15,"All in one DevOps Platform with Powerful CI/CD",5.0,"i have been using GitLab for several months now and it is been a great experience overall. What I really appreciate is how everything from version control to CI/CD pipelines is integrated into a single platform. It simplifies the workflow and reduces the need to depend on multiple tools. The interface is clean and user-friendly, and managing repositories, merge requests, and issues is very straightforward. The built-in CI/CD is one of GitLab's strongest features — it's easy to configure and works reliably in most cases. That said, there are moments when pipeline performance slows down, especially under heavy load, but it's nothing deal-breaking. Also, for beginners, the platform might feel a bit overwhelming at first due to the wide range of features.","Fellowing points given below 1. It is difficult to learn for new users 2. Occasional performance slowdowns"
16,"Robust CI/CD Features, But Community Support Needs Improvement",5.0,"The platform offers a wide variety of features that support and advance our CI/CD practice.","The community and support leave something to be desired. There are problems that have been reported by numerous users over the years, yet they still have not been addressed."
17,"The GitLab Admin POV: One Tool to Rule Them All?",5.0,"From an admin eyes , GitLab offers a comprehensive and effective all-in-one DevSecOps platform that minimizes the need to manage multiple toolchains. The centralized user and group management, especially with SAML SSO and SCIM integration for enterprise tiers with almost all IDPs, significantly simplifies access control and identity lifecycle management for Gitlab.","Managing Gitlab runner infrastructure (especially for autoscaling or hybrid cloud environments) can be complex and will need close monitoring and resource Altering."
18,"Very Efficient and Structured Solution for the whole Workflow from Management to Deployment",4.0,"It started out with a very minimalistic approach, but over time, they have consistently enhanced their features and addressed bugs with better support for customer satisfaction. The platform is now easier to use and less complicated. It also integrates with all the popular mailing, communication, collaboration, and alerting applications. We use it for all our work tracking and releasing. Very easy to implement and build upon.","Still has less features compared to peers. But it has everything we really need."
19,"Feature-Rich Platform with a Slick UI",4.0,"It's an all-in-one solution for hosting both the sources and the resulting artifacts, good integration to other tools","I'm missing a way to orchestrate reviews/merges across multiple repos"
20,"All-in-One DevOps Platform That Simplifies CI/CD and Collaboration",4.5,"GitLab combines source code management, CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and DevOps automation into a single, unified platform. I love how seamless the Merge Request workflow is, and the pipeline configuration using .gitlab-ci.yml gives us full control. Its self-hosting option is a big plus for privacy-focused teams.","The UI can feel heavy at times, and pipeline debugging isn't always straightforward for beginners. Also, compared to GitHub, the community plugins and marketplace are more limited. Occasionally, documentation for advanced features could be more detailed."
21,"Best tool for Planning and tracking your development and Deployement",4.5,"Setting up our groups and Projects in best manner. Managing my backlogs and features. Managing story and its pipeline and tracking till deployment. Better tracking of Sprint and story movement from grooming to deployment.

It also allows importing projects from existing repositories such as GitHub, BitBucket, etc. which is very good. It also has issue tracking and milestones UI, which is simple, easy to track, and one of the best. We can also explore public projects very easily as well.","The pricing is quite high and it does not have any gist feature to share snippets of code. It also does not comes with student pricing, rather it provides a 30-day free ultimate plan which is nice but a student feature would be appreciated very much."
44,"Very helpful for code sharing with team",5.0,"Cherry pick feature for hotfix production release","Sometime stash changes overidrd or conflict"
45,"Gitlab- a web based project management repository",4.0,"It is very easy to configure and does not require any extra space on the computer. One just need to configure it and it is ready to use. Alongside, this is also a reliable way to process, maintain and manage the code with minimum extra effort. It's accuracy is another added advantage","It has its own limitations like very little or no customisation. . Also, though easy to configure but it can only be used for native application and it doesn't have compliance license"
46,"Better alternative for github",4.5,"I loved the user interface of Gitlab and the fact that is offers more features at very cheap rate. Gitlab provides their own runners therefore it is very convienent to use. Interface is very good and easy to understand comparitive to its counterpart jenkins. In gitlab pipeline runs automatically if we use a specific keyword but in jenkins we have to do so much configuration.","The amount of gitlab i have used i did not found any things to dislike it.
